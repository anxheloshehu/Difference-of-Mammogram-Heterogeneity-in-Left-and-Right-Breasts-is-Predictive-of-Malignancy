# Diference of Mammmogram Heterogenity in left and right breast

The absolute difference in heterogeneity between
a patientâ€™s left and right mammograms is a malignancy marker
when using raw digital X-ray images. A malignancy predictor
can be created by tuning a threshold on this marker. These
univariable predictors outperformed state-of-the-art methods.
For processed images from low-dose devices, the heterogeneity
difference was not a valid marker. Further research in low-dose
technologies requires access to raw mammographic images.
